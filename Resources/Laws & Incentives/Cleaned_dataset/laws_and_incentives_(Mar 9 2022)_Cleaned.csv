vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB\'s emissions control program for MY 2017 through 2025 combines the
control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and requirements for
ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced Clean Cars. In
December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory requirements that allow
vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency\'s GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to serve as compliance with
California\'s adopted GHG emissions requirements for those same model
years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018-2025 are based on a credit system
as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in

dual-fuel vehicles when operating on an alternative fuel. MY 2009 and
subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles must meet specified fleet average greenhouse gas
(GHG) exhaust emissions requirements. Each manufacturer must comply with
these fleet average GHG requirements, which are based on California Air
Resources Board (CARB) calculations. Bi-fuel, flexible fuel, dual-fuel,
and grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles may be eligible for an
alternative compliance method.

In December 2012, CARB finalized regulatory requirements, referred to as
LEV III, which allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency\'s GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to
serve as compliance with California\'s adopted GHG emissions
requirements for those same model years. For more information, see the

involvement in a Multi-State ZEV Task Force (Task Force).

By January 2021, the Task Force will develop a multi-state action plan
to support electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The Task
Force will consider actions to accomplish the goals of the MOU,
including limiting all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sales in the
signatory states to ZEVs by 2050. The signatory states will also seek to
accelerate the deployment of medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs to benefit
disadvantaged communities and explore opportunities to coordinate and
partner with key stakeholders.

2018-2021. Building on the 2014 Action Plan, the 2018 Action Plan makes
recommendations for states and other key partners in five priority
areas:

-   Raising consumer awareness and interest in electric vehicle
    technology;
-   Building out a reliable and convenient residential, workplace and
    public charging/fueling infrastructure network;
-   Continuing and improving access to consumer purchase and
    non-financial incentives;
-   Expanding public and private sector fleet adoption; and
-   Supporting dealership efforts to increase ZEV sales.

government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the

11875,WY,Regional Electric Vehicle (REV) West Plan,"Wyoming joined Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
and Utah (Signatory States) in signing the REV West [memorandum of
understanding](https://www.naseo.org/Data/Sites/1/revwest_mou.pdf) (MOU)
to create an Intermountain West Electric Vehicle (EV) Corridor that will
make it possible to seamlessly drive an EV across the Signatory States\'
major transportation corridors.

In 2019, the Signatory States signed a revised [REV West
MOU](https://www.naseo.org/issues/transportation/rev-west) to update
their EV corridor goals based on progress to date. Signatory States are
committed to:

-   Educate consumers and fleet owners to raise EV awareness, reduce
    range anxiety, and increase EV adoption;
-   Coordinate on EV charging station locations to achieve a consistent
    user experience across Signatory States;
-   Use and promote the REV West [Voluntary Minimum
    Standards](https://www.naseo.org/Data/Sites/1/revwest_volminimumstandards.pdf)
    for EV charging stations and explore opportunities for implementing
    the standards in Signatory States;
-   Identify and develop opportunities to incorporate EV charging
    stations into planning and development processes such as building
    codes, metering policies, and renewable energy generation projects;
-   Encourage EV manufacturers to stock and market a wide variety of EVs
    within the Signatory States;
-   Identify, respond to, and collaborate on funding opportunities to
    support the development of the plan; and
-   Support the build-out of direct current (DC) fast charging stations
    along EV corridors through investments, partnerships, and other
    mechanisms.

The Signatory States maintain a coordination group composed of senior
leadership from each state who meet on a quarterly basis and report on
the above actions. For more information, see the [REV
West](https://www.naseo.org/issues/transportation/rev-west) website.

12812,WY,Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) Infrastructure Support,"Wyoming utilities joined the National Electric Highway Coalition (NEHC),
committing to create a network of direct current fast (DC Fast) charging
stations connecting major highway systems from the Atlantic Coast to the
Pacific of the United States. NEHC utility members agree to ensure
efficient and effective fast charging deployment plans that enable long
distance EV travel, avoiding duplication among coalition utilities, and
complement existing corridor DC fast charging sites. For more
information, including a list of participating utilities and states, see
the [NEHC](https://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/Pages/NEHC.aspx) website.
